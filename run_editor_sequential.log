This marks a significant milestone as it will be the first time Kohli will be representing Delhi in any format since the 2013 Challenger Trophy, where he led the Delhi team to the final. He captained India under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of ODI specialist by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings and holds the position, as of May 2017. Kohli joined the Indian cricket team in 2020.

However, historical evidence suggests that Aurangzeb stopped the practice of giving jharokha darshan at the end of the 10th year of his reign. This decision was influenced by various factors, including a desire to suppress political failures, financial strain, and his orthodox beliefs, which led him to view the practice as not in line with Islamic principles.

2025-02-05 18:18:20,822 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Jama Masjid was built by Mughal Emperor Akbar between 1644 and 1656. While the exact cost is not definitively recorded, historical estimates suggest it was a significant investment. The mosque was inaugurated by an imam from Bukhara, present-day Uzbekistan. Completed in 1656, it features three great gates, four towers, and two 40-meter-high minarets made of red sandstone and white marble. The courtyard can accommodate over 25,000 individuals, with three domes on the terrace surrounded by the two minarets. Additionally, 899 black borders are marked on the floor for worshippers. The architectural plan of the Badshahi Masjid in Lahore, Pakistan, built by Akbar's son Aurangzeb, bears similarities to the Jama Masjid in Delhi.

2025-02-05 18:19:50,833 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Juan Seguín, a prominent figure in Texas history, played a key role in overseeing the recovery of the abandoned ashes in 1837 and officiating at the February 25 funeral at Mission San Francisco de la Espada. The burial location was initially mentioned in the March 28 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register as where the principal heap of ashes was found. While there has been historical confusion surrounding the burial site, some sources suggest it may be located at Mission San Francisco de la Espada. In 1936, remains believed to belong to the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando and later re-interred in a marble sarcophagus. The identity of the remains in the sarcophagus has been a subject of debate, with some believing it contains the ashes of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, potentially buried at Mission San Francisco de la Espada.

After his death in 1890, Seguín was buried in the town that bears his name, and a statue was erected in his honor. The specific issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register from March 28 cannot be referenced to confirm the claim about the principal heap of ashes, as the newspaper was not in circulation until October 1835, after the events at the Alamo.

2025-02-05 18:21:14,426 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Juan Seguín, a significant figure in Texas history, played a key role in overseeing the withdrawal of the Mexican army from Texas. While historical records indicate his involvement in the recovery of the abandoned ashes of the Alamo defenders in 1837, Seguín was not present at the Alamo during the siege in March 1836. He was dispatched with a letter to Sam Houston for reinforcements and later fought at the Battle of San Jacinto in April. Seguín's participation in the funeral at Mission San Francisco de la Espada on February 25 is documented. The exact burial site of the Alamo dead has been subject to historical uncertainty, with some sources suggesting Mission San Francisco de la Espada as a possible location.

"Chances" debuted at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week of October 21, 2009, but fell off the chart the following week. It did, however, achieve success on adult radio formats, reaching the top 10 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart after spending 24 weeks on the chart. While there is no evidence to support the claim that the song was featured in various films and television shows, it remains a notable hit for Faith Hill.

2025-02-05 18:25:01,134 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Spanish made landfall in Mexico in 1519, led by Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador. This expedition followed an earlier one to Yucatán in 1517 led by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba. Two years later, Cortés and his retinue set sail, initiating the expedition of exploration and conquest. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire culminated in its final victory on August 13, 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors, led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger, captured Emperor Montezuma and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, leading to the establishment of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. The founding of Mexico City over the ruins of Tenochtitlan symbolized the continuation of violence, as Spanish efforts to control flooding in the Valley altered the landscape, transforming a cityscape once dominated by pyramids into one adorned with crosses.

The doctrine also specified that the U.S. would not intervene in the internal affairs of existing European colonies. While the declaration sent a clear signal to European powers to abstain from involvement in the Americas, it was largely ignored outside U.S. borders due to the United States' limited military and naval power at the time. For instance, in 1833, the United States did not invoke the Monroe Doctrine to oppose British occupation of the Falkland Islands, nor did it intervene when Britain and France imposed a naval blockade against Argentina in 1845.

However, the Monroe Doctrine later became a mainstay of U.S. foreign policy, laying the groundwork for U.S. expansionist and interventionist practices in the decades to come. For instance, in 1833, the United States did not invoke the Monroe Doctrine to oppose British occupation of the Falkland Islands, nor did it intervene when Britain and France imposed a naval blockade against Argentina in 1845.

It warned that any European attempt to influence independent states in North or South America would be viewed as a hostile act by the United States. The doctrine also specified that the U.S. would not intervene in the internal affairs of existing European colonies. While the declaration sent a clear signal to European powers to abstain from involvement in the Americas, it was initially disregarded by the great powers of Europe.

2025-02-05 18:34:41,354 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The music video for "If I Could Turn Back Time," featuring Cher and her band performing aboard the battleship USS Missouri in Long Beach, was directed by Marty Callner. The video was filmed on July 1, 1989, while the ship was stationed at the former Long Beach Naval Shipyard at Pier D. Cher's son, Elijah Blue Allman, appeared as one of the band's guitarists in the video, wearing dark glasses and a Jimi Hendrix t-shirt. Despite some controversy, the crew ultimately accepted the video shoot. Following the backlash, the Navy decided to prohibit musicians from filming music videos on U.S. Navy ships in the future.

2025-02-05 18:35:47,491 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Born and raised in Los Angeles, Conrad Dunn studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts - Los Angeles and with Stella Adler in New York. After seeing him on stage, a casting director asked him to read for the role of Francis "Psycho" Soyer in Stripes (1981), his first feature film. His introductory speech, described by one reviewer as "Conrad Dunn's adroit tribute to Travis Bickle," was singled out by film critic Roger Ebert: "The movie has especially good writing in several scenes. My favorite comes near the beginning, during a session when recruits in the new platoon get to know one another. One obviously psycho draftee, who looks like Robert De Niro, quietly announces that if his fellow soldiers touch him, touch his stuff, or interfere in any way with his person or his privacy, he will quite simply be forced to kill them.".

2025-02-05 18:38:32,224 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Amrish Puri was not the first choice for the role of Gabbar Singh. Initially, Danny Denzongpa was approached for the role, but due to scheduling conflicts, he had to pull out. This led to Amjad Khan eventually taking on the role. To prepare for the character, Amjad Khan read "Abhishapth Chambal," a book on Chambal dacoits written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri. While both Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjeev Kumar expressed interest in playing Gabbar Singh, the decision-makers believed Sanjeev Kumar already had the audience's sympathy from his previous roles. During the shooting, there were concerns about Amjad Khan's voice not being menacing enough, but attempts to replace him were unsuccessful.

2025-02-05 18:40:56,437 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Although popular among college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were relatively low, prompting Marvel to relaunch Black Panther in a self-titled series in 1977. The series was spearheaded by the character's co-creator, Jack Kirby, who returned to Marvel in 1975 after a six-year hiatus at rival DC Comics. Kirby's work on the Black Panther series began with his initial contributions in Fantastic Four and Tales of Suspense (later renamed Captain America), establishing the character's origin, appearance, and key traits. Kirby's involvement extended to approximately 14 issues featuring Black Panther. After the initial 12 issues, Ed Hannigan, Jerry Bingham, and Roger Stern also contributed to the series. The Black Panther series ran for 15 issues from January 1977 to January 1978. Following its cancellation, the content intended for issues #16-18 was published in Marvel Premiere #51-53. The Black Panther comic book was first released in 1966.

2025-02-05 18:43:29,141 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: When Harry reported Voldemort's return at the end of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dumbledore reactivated the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, as Voldemort began to regain power. The Order, originally formed during the First Wizarding War in the 1970s, consisted of a diverse group of individuals, including wizards, Squibs, and other allies, dedicated to opposing Voldemort. While the battle against Voldemort resulted in heavy casualties and the loss of many original members, some returned when the Death Eaters resurrected their leader. The Order established their headquarters at various locations for security reasons, including Grimmauld Place and later at the Burrow. Dumbledore played a crucial role in leading the Order until his death in book six, after which the headquarters' location became vulnerable, leading to its relocation. Albus Dumbledore, the founder and leader of the Order from 1970 to June 30, 1997, was instrumental in guiding the Order through its missions and challenges.

2025-02-05 18:45:15,766 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, delegates from five states, including New Jersey, met primarily to address trade issues among the states. While the convention did not specifically call for a constitutional convention to discuss improvements to the Articles of Confederation, it did lay the groundwork for broader reforms. The subsequent Constitutional Convention began on May 25, 1787, in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania State House, later known as Independence Hall. Rhode Island chose not to participate in the Constitutional Convention, with historical evidence suggesting that its decision was rooted in a history of independent thinking rather than concerns about potential disadvantages. Initially hesitant, Rhode Island did not ratify the Constitution until May 1790, becoming the thirteenth state to do so, a year after the new federal government commenced. The Annapolis delegates recommended a convention be held in Philadelphia the following year, leading to the Constitutional Convention held from May to September 1787.

2025-02-05 18:46:22,361 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Red Sea is indeed one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, with salinity levels ranging from approximately 36 ‰ in the southern part due to the influence of the Gulf of Aden water, to 41 ‰ in the northern part, primarily influenced by the Gulf of Suez water and high evaporation rates. The average salinity of the Red Sea is around 40 ‰. On the practical salinity scale (psu), the average salinity of the world's seawater is about 35 ‰, equivalent to 3.5% of actual dissolved salts. While historical data from 2000 to 2020 indicates that decreased precipitation, rather than increased temperature, has led to rising salinity levels in the Red Sea, supporting the view that it is among the saltiest bodies of water globally.

2025-02-05 18:46:40,048 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Red Sea is known for its high salinity levels, ranging from approximately 36 ‰ in the southern part influenced by the Gulf of Aden water, to 41 ‰ in the northern part primarily influenced by the Gulf of Suez water and high evaporation rates. The average salinity of the Red Sea is estimated to be around 40 ‰. On the practical salinity scale (psu), the average salinity of the world's seawater is about 35 ‰, equivalent to 3.5% of actual dissolved salts. Historical data from 2000 to 2020 suggests that decreased precipitation, rather than increased temperature, has contributed to rising salinity levels in the Red Sea, supporting its reputation as one of the saltiest bodies of water globally.

The average salinity of the Red Sea is estimated to be around 40 ‰, based on historical data. Salinity measurements in the Red Sea have been historically sparse due to the time-consuming nature of traditional methods. Recent advancements in electronic sensors within oceanographic instruments have facilitated more frequent and accurate measurements. While historical data from 2000 to 2020 suggests that decreased precipitation has contributed to rising salinity levels in the Red Sea, further studies are required to confirm this trend.

2025-02-05 18:50:31,507 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Barcelona has won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup four times and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup three times, a notable achievement. They have also participated in the Latin Cup twice, winning it in 1949 as champions of Spain. Due to a fixture clash with the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the Latin Cup was not held that year. Barcelona's victory in the Latin Cup in 1949 is a record shared with Real Madrid and Milan. While they did not secure a victory in the European Cup during the early years of the competition, now known as the UEFA Champions League, they have since claimed the trophy five times. Their first victory in this competition was in 1992, with subsequent wins in 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2015. Barcelona's total number of UEFA Champions League wins is five, with their first victory in the competition occurring in 1992.

2025-02-05 18:54:02,970 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The pug is a breed of dog known for its distinctive features, including deep wrinkles, a curly tail, a compact body, a large round head, expressive eyes, a short muzzle, and a slightly pushed-in face. Originating from China, the pug has been identified as a breed with ancient roots. While the exact timeline of its development is not definitively established, genetic studies suggest that the pug, like other ancient breeds, has experienced limited recent admixture with other breeds due to geographic and cultural isolation. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the pug as their 134th breed in 1992.

2025-02-05 18:55:40,482 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Last of Us is an action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is set in the post-apocalyptic city of Boston, where players assume the role of Joel, a smuggler entrusted with escorting a teenage girl named Ellie. The game is experienced from a third-person perspective, with players utilizing firearms and makeshift weapons to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game primarily focuses on a single-player experience due to story complexity, gameplay mechanics, and technical challenges. While the original version of the game does not include an online multiplayer mode, Naughty Dog is working on a new, large-scale standalone multiplayer game separate from The Last of Us series. The multiplayer mode of The Last of Us emphasizes strategic gameplay, requiring players to adapt their combat approach due to limited ammo and lack of regenerative health, distinguishing it from traditional third-person cover shooters.

The regulation aimed to establish a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-liter pre-war Grand Prix cars were indeed permitted to compete against the pre-war 1.5-liter supercharged 'voiturettes'. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that pre-war supercharged 3-liter Grand Prix cars were prohibited from racing under these regulations. The first race held under these new rules was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix on September 1, where Giuseppe Campari secured victory in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.

In the Pacific theater, early U.S. combat activities included efforts such as the Flying Tigers. The Axis powers fought by the United States in World War II were Germany, Italy, and Japan. The U.S. initially maintained neutrality due to congressional restrictions on providing aid to belligerents in the European conflict, as outlined in the Neutrality Acts.

2025-02-05 19:03:53,247 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The conservative federal government of Brian Mulroney first began implementing metrication in Canada in the mid-1970s, with metric product labeling introduced during that time. In 1972, the provinces agreed to make all road signs metric by 1977. Resistance to metrication was notable, particularly in sectors where the federal Weights and Measures Act mandated metric usage. The metrication of gasoline and diesel fuel sales occurred in the late 1970s. In response, 37 Liberal Members of Parliament opened a "Freedom to Measure" gas station in Carleton Place, Ontario, offering gas in both imperial gallons and liters. The city of Peterborough, Ontario, was a significant center of opposition to metrication and served as one of the government's test centers for the process. Sarah Jones, a Member of Parliament representing Peterborough, emerged as a prominent critic of metrication. Some government employees faced consequences for their opposition, such as Tom Smith, an official with Revenue Canada, who was dismissed for publicly opposing mandatory metric conversion.

2025-02-05 19:04:58,103 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The metrication process in Canada began in the early 1970s, with the federal government under Pierre Trudeau initiating the transition. By the mid-1970s, metric product labeling was introduced. In 1972, the provinces agreed to convert all road signs to metric measurements by 1977. Resistance to metrication was evident, especially in sectors regulated by the federal Weights and Measures Act. The conversion of gasoline and diesel fuel sales to metric units took place in 1981. In response to these changes, some individuals, including 37 Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament, established a "Freedom to Measure" gas station in Carleton Place, Ontario, offering both imperial gallons and liters of gas. Notably, the city of Peterborough, Ontario, emerged as a significant hub of opposition to metrication. Sarah Jones, a Member of Parliament representing Peterborough, gained prominence as a vocal critic of metrication. Some government employees, like Tom Smith, an official with Revenue Canada, faced repercussions for publicly opposing mandatory metric conversion, with Smith being dismissed for his stance. The reasons for resistance to metrication in Canada can be traced back to influence from its ten-times larger neighbor to the south, rather than an anti-Europe sentiment as seen in the UK. The Metric Commission actively promoted metrication across various sectors, with specific timelines for incorporating metric measurements into Canadian life, such as road signs by 1977, teaching in schools from 1975 to 1980, and food packaging by mid-1976.

The Commission was formed following the release of "The White Paper on Metric Conversion," a January 1971 federal government document which noted most nations had adopted the metric system and anticipated that the United States would do likewise. The commission's logo was designed by Gottschalk+Ash Toronto, designed by Stuart Ash, and licensed for use on any metric products (such as rulers). It is based on the logo of the 1967 Canadian Centennial by the same firm.

The election of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney in 1984 resulted in the abolition of the Metric Commission on March 31, 1985, ending the process of affirmative metrication in Canada. Some regulations requiring metric measurements have since been repealed or are no longer enforced, and training on metric conversion was not universal. Poor metrication training was a contributing.

2025-02-05 19:11:14,630 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Abuja (/əˈbuːdʒə/) is the capital city of Nigeria located in the center of the country within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city that was mainly constructed in the 1980s. Abuja officially replaced Lagos as the capital in 1991, not in March 2006 as previously stated. The decision to move the capital was influenced by various factors, including the need to establish a political center separate from Lagos, which was the economic hub of West Africa. Abuja's geography is characterized by Aso Rock, a 400-meter (1,300 ft) monolith formed by water erosion. The presidential complex, national assembly, supreme court, and much of the city are situated to the south of the rock. Additionally, Zuma Rock, a 792-meter (2,598 ft) monolith, is located just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna.

2025-02-05 19:12:54,320 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Abuja (/əˈbuːdʒə/) is the capital city of Nigeria located in the center of the country within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city that was officially established in 1976, with development efforts continuing throughout the 1980s. Abuja officially replaced Lagos as the capital on December 12, 1991, not in March 2006 as previously stated. The decision to move the capital was influenced by various factors, including the need to establish a political center separate from Lagos, which was the economic hub of West Africa. Abuja's geography is characterized by Aso Rock, a 400-meter (1,300 ft) monolith formed by water erosion. The presidential complex, national assembly, supreme court, and much of the city are situated to the south of the rock. Additionally, Zuma Rock, a 792-meter (2,598 ft) monolith, is located just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna. The main reasons for choosing Abuja as the new capital over Lagos in 1991 included its purpose-built modern urban planning, centralized location within Nigeria, providing easier access from all parts of the country, fostering national unity, and symbolizing Nigeria's diversity. The decision to establish Abuja as the new capital was driven by the need for a neutral and unified political center, reflecting Nigeria's aspirations for national cohesion, rather than in 2006 as previously mentioned.

Abuja, situated at 1,180 feet (360 meters) above sea level, offers a cooler climate and lower humidity compared to Lagos.

2025-02-05 19:14:03,465 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, resulting in 58 fatalities and over 850 injuries. The shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:18 p.m. PDT. The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Approximately an hour and fifteen minutes after the shooting, at 11:20 p.m., Paddock was found deceased in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Despite an extensive investigation, authorities were unable to determine Paddock's specific motive. The number of bullets fired by Paddock was tallied by the FBI and the Clark County Sheriff's Department's forensics lab, as reported in a new forensics report on the incident.

There are four stages of spinal cavity formation from the neural tube: the neural plate, neural fold, neural tube, and the spinal cavity. Neural differentiation occurs within the spinal cavity portion of the tube. As the neural tube develops, the notochord secretes a factor called sonic hedgehog or Shh. This secretion induces the floor plate to also secrete Shh, leading to the development of motor neurons in the basal plate. During neural tube maturation, the lateral walls thicken, forming a longitudinal groove known as the sulcus limitans, which divides the spinal cavity into dorsal and ventral portions. The ectoderm above secretes bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), triggering the roof plate to secrete BMP as well, initiating the development of sensory neurons in the alar plate. Opposing gradients of morphogens like BMP and Shh establish distinct domains of dividing cells along the dorsal-ventral axis. Dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors. As dorsal and ventral column cells proliferate, the neural tube's lumen narrows to form the small central canal of the spinal cavity. The sulcus limitans separates the alar plate and basal plate.

2025-02-05 19:19:54,661 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The spinal cavity is formed by the neural tube during development through a process known as primary neurulation. This process involves distinct steps starting with an open neural plate that eventually bends and closes to form the neural tube, which becomes the embryonic brain and spinal cord, comprising the central nervous system. The four stages of spinal cavity formation from the neural tube are the neural plate, neural fold, neural tube, and the spinal cavity. Neural differentiation primarily occurs within the spinal cavity portion of the tube. The notochord secretes a factor called sonic hedgehog or Shh during neural tube development, inducing the floor plate to also secrete Shh, leading to the development of motor neurons in the basal plate. The lateral walls thicken as the neural tube matures, forming a longitudinal groove called the sulcus limitans, which divides the spinal cavity into dorsal and ventral portions. Gradients of morphogens like BMP and Shh establish distinct domains of dividing cells along the dorsal-ventral axis. Dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors. The neural tube's lumen narrows as dorsal and ventral column cells proliferate, forming the small central canal of the spinal cavity. The sulcus limitans separates the alar plate and basal plate. The floor plate secretes netrins, acting as chemoattractants for the decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure, guiding them towards the thalamus. Following the closure of the caudal neuropore and the formation of the brain's ventricles containing choroid plexus tissue, the central canal of the caudal spinal cavity fills with cerebrospinal fluid.

By 750 BC, the first Maya cities began to emerge, showcasing monumental architecture such as large temples with intricate stucco facades.

In the 9th century, a significant political collapse occurred in the central Maya region, resulting in warfare, city abandonment, and a shift in population northwards. The Postclassic period saw the ascendancy of Chichen Itza in the north and the expansion of the K'iche' kingdom in the Guatemalan highlands. Ultimately, in the 16th century, the Spanish Empire colonized the Mesoamerican region, leading to the fall of Nojpetén, the last Maya city, in 1697.

The Postclassic period saw the ascendancy of Chichen Itza in the north and the expansion of the K'iche' kingdom in the Guatemalan highlands. Ultimately, in the 16th century, the Spanish Empire colonized the Mesoamerican region, leading to the fall of Nojpetén, the last Maya city, in 1697. The deciphering of hieroglyphic script and the reconstruction of Maya history began in the 19th century, with scholars like Alfred Maudslay compiling catalogs of Maya buildings, monuments, and inscriptions from major known cities.

Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced in early 1973 that no further draft orders would be issued, effectively bringing an end to the military draft. The evidence supports that legislative and executive actions were indeed needed to end the draft, as indicated by President Nixon's message in April 1970 outlining efforts to make military pay more equitable and reduce the need for conscription. President Nixon expressed his desire to minimize the disruptive impact of the military draft on individual lives and requested Congress for authority to implement draft reforms in May 1969. The timeline of events surrounding the end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam in December 1972 and the last men conscripted in June 1973 is corroborated with historical records.

2025-02-05 19:28:54,132 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: A sister chromatid refers to the identical copies (chromatids) formed by the DNA replication of a chromosome, with both copies joined together by a common centromere. In other words, a sister chromatid may also be said to be 'one-half' of the duplicated chromosome. A pair of sister chromatids is called a dyad. A full set of sister chromatids is created during the synthesis (S) phase of interphase, when all the chromosomes in a cell are replicated. The concept of sister chromatids and the term itself were introduced into scientific literature to describe these structures.

2025-02-05 19:35:45,921 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: In total, 184 events are listed, with widely varying degrees of damage. A hurricane in 1609 was responsible for the first permanent settlement on Bermuda: in late July, the British ship Sea Venture, bound for Jamestown, nearly foundered in the storm and sought refuge on the islands, which the passengers found surprisingly hospitable. Hurricane Fabian was the most intense storm to impact the territory in modern times, although it officially did not make landfall. It was the only storm to have its name retired for its effects in Bermuda. The costliest storms were Fabian and Gonzalo, which caused about $300 million and $200-400 million in damage, respectively (in 2003 and 2014 USD). Adjusting for inflation and continued development, Fabian would likely have caused around $650 million in damage had it struck in 2014. The most recent tropical cyclone to affect the islands was Hurricane Jose in September 2017, contrary to the opinion stating it was in May 2020. The retirement of storm names, like in the case of Hurricane Fabian in Bermuda, is determined by the World Meteorological Organization, which officially retires names for at least 10 years to prevent confusion with other storms of the same name. The Atlantic HURDAT2 dataset, which provides detailed information on tropical cyclones affecting Bermuda, is maintained by the Hurricane Research Division. The World Meteorological Organization maintains records of tropical cyclones affecting Bermuda, and the most up-to-date information on these events can be accessed through the Atlantic HURDAT2 dataset maintained by the Hurricane Research Division.

2025-02-05 19:37:11,291 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The guidelines for the M'Naghten rules, which pertain to evaluating criminal responsibility for defendants claiming insanity, were established in British courts following the case of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843. M'Naghten, a Scottish woodcutter, attempted to assassinate the British Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, under the delusion that Peel was conspiring against him. Tragically, M'Naghten mistakenly killed Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, instead. During his trial, multiple witnesses testified to his mental state, supporting the claim of insanity. As a result, the jury acquitted M'Naghten, finding him not guilty by reason of insanity. This case marked M'Naghten as the first individual to be acquitted on the grounds of insanity.

2025-02-05 19:41:33,762 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The S&P 500 stock market index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, comprises predominantly growth stocks issued by 500 large-cap companies and traded on American stock exchanges. Growth stocks are characterized by investors expecting substantial capital gains due to strong company growth, leading to potentially high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. In contrast, value stocks, often overlooked by the market, may gain value over time. The index is weighted by free-float market capitalization, giving companies with strong growth prospects a greater influence. While commonly known as the S&P 500, it actually includes 503 stocks due to the inclusion of two share classes of stock from three component companies. Value stocks are considered undervalued and are purchased with the idea that they will perform better than expected, while growth stocks represent companies that have shown solid earnings and growth, purchased with the expectation of faster-than-market growth rates. Index stock funds aim to replicate the price movement of a specific index, such as the S&P 500, which consists of 500 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization.

In 1821, following Mexico's successful war for independence, California became part of Mexico. After the Mexican-American War, Mexico ceded California to the United States in 1848. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush, starting in 1848, brought significant social and demographic changes, with a large influx of emigrants from the East and abroad, leading to an economic boom.

According to hagiographies, his disciples assumed leadership roles in each matha, establishing a guru-sishya parampara (lineage of masters and disciples) within each institution. The title Shankaracharya, used by heads of certain monasteries in India, is derived from his name.

It was also their final season in the American Football League. The Chiefs achieved an 11-3 record and secured a 23-7 victory in Super Bowl IV against the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings from the NFL. They triumphed over their rivals, the Oakland Raiders, in the final AFL Championship game, clinching their third AFL championship in franchise history. Coached by Hank Stram, the team was led by quarterback Len Dawson and boasted a formidable defense spearheaded by Bobby Bell, Willie Lanier, Buck Buchanan, and Curley Culp.

The contemporary composition of nucleobases is likely a result of multiple selection pressures that operated during early chemical and biological evolution. The prebiotic formation of polymeric nucleic acids employing the native bases remains a challenging problem to reconcile, although hypotheses suggest that the emerging RNA world may have included many types of nucleobases.

2025-02-05 19:52:31,593 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: In the biological sciences, nitrogenous bases, such as purines like adenine (A) and guanine (G), and pyrimidines like cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U), are commonly referred to as nucleobases due to their crucial role in nucleic acids. These nucleobases are fundamental components of DNA and RNA, forming the genetic code that determines the characteristics of living organisms. They play a vital role in the replication and transmission of genetic information, enabling cells to function properly. Purines, like adenine and guanine, have a double-ring structure, while pyrimidines, including cytosine, thymine, and uracil, have a single-ring structure. The terminology shift from predominantly referring to these compounds as nitrogenous bases to nucleobases in the context of biological sciences did not occur as part of the development of an international system of organic nomenclature in the late nineteenth century, particularly during the Geneva Nomenclature Congress in 1892, as there was no systematic approach leading to considerable variation in terminology across different regions and cultures. The contemporary composition of nucleobases is likely a result of multiple selection pressures that operated during early chemical and biological evolution. The prebiotic formation of polymeric nucleic acids employing the native bases remains a challenging problem to reconcile, although hypotheses suggest that the emerging RNA world may have included many types of nucleobases.

2025-02-05 19:53:47,045 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: Following his release, Po'pay, along with a number of other pueblo leaders, planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt. Po'pay took up residence in Taos Pueblo, far from the capital of Santa Fe, and spent the next five years seeking support for a revolt among the 46 pueblo towns. He gained the support of the northern Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. The Pecos Pueblo, located 50 miles east of the Rio Grande, pledged its participation in the revolt, as did the Zuni and Hopi villages, situated 120 and 200 miles respectively west of the Rio Grande. The southern Tiwa (Tiguex) towns near Santa Fe and the Piro pueblos south of the principal pueblo population centers near the present-day city of Socorro did not join the revolt. The Spanish population of about 2,400, including mixed-blood mestizos, and Indian servants and retainers, was thinly scattered throughout the region. Santa Fe was the only place that approximated being a town. The Spanish could only muster 170 men with arms. The pueblos joining the revolt likely had 2,000 or more adult men capable of using native weapons such as the bow and arrow. It is possible that some Apache and Navajo participated in the revolt. Po'pay informed the Pueblos that the uprising would occur on the new August moon, coinciding with the ripening of corn. Runners were trained in the plan depicted in pictographs and were tasked with warning all the seventy-odd Pueblos that the Spanish had been persecuting for nearly a century, including the Hopi villages over 300 miles away. The successful revolt led to the Spanish retreating back to their colonies in New Spain (now Mexico).

Po'pay resided in Taos Pueblo, distant from Santa Fe, and spent five years rallying support for the uprising among the 46 pueblo towns. He garnered backing from the northern Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande Valley. The Pecos Pueblo, located 50 miles east of the Rio Grande, committed to the revolt, as did the Zuni and Hopi villages situated 120 and 200 miles west of the Rio Grande, respectively. However, the southern Tiwa (Tiguex) towns near Santa Fe and the Piro pueblos south of the main pueblo centers near present-day Socorro did not participate. The Spanish population, totaling about 2,400 individuals, including mixed-blood mestizos and Indian servants, was thinly spread throughout the region, with Santa Fe being the most town-like settlement. The Spanish could only muster 170 armed men, while the pueblos supporting the revolt likely had a significant number of adult men skilled in using native weapons like bows and arrows. Some Apache and Navajo may have also joined the uprising. Po'pay coordinated the revolt to coincide with the new August moon and the ripening of corn, using trained runners to spread the message through pictographs to all the Pueblos, including the Hopi villages over 300 miles away. The successful revolt forced the Spanish to retreat to their colonies in New Spain (now Mexico). The Pueblo Revolt resulted in the deaths of 400 Spaniards and the expulsion of the remaining 2,000 settlers from the province. The Spaniards later returned to New Mexico twelve years after the revolt. Po'pay sought support for the revolt among the 46 pueblo towns by organizing and leading a coalition of Pueblo, Apache, and mixed Indigenous-Spanish communities, ultimately driving Spanish colonists out of New Mexico.

2025-02-05 19:56:10,099 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation, the solar nebular disk model (SNDM), is often attributed to the Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His 1969 book "Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets" significantly influenced scientists' understanding of planetary formation. Safronov's work in this book addressed many key challenges in the planetary formation process, laying the foundation for further developments in the field. George Wetherill later expanded on Safronov's ideas, introducing the concept of runaway accretion. Initially focused on the solar system, the SNDM eventually gained recognition as a model applicable to planetary formation processes across the universe. While Safronov's ideas were initially overlooked, they gained traction after being shared with NASA by an American graduate student.

2025-02-05 20:00:47,871 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: The Bourne Legacy is a 2012 American action thriller film directed by Tony Gilroy, serving as the fourth installment in the series of films adapted from the Jason Bourne novels created by Robert Ludlum. While the film shares the title with Van Lustbader's first Bourne novel, it deviates significantly from the book's storyline. In contrast to the novel's focus on Jason Bourne, the film centers on black ops agent Aaron Cross, portrayed by Jeremy Renner, an original character. The movie also stars Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton. The film showcases Aaron Cross during the events depicted in The Bourne Ultimatum film, where he and Dr. Marta Shearing are on a mission in Manila to find a viral strain that will stabilize Cross's genetic enhancements without the need for "chems." The Bourne Legacy novel by Eric Van Lustbader was actually published on June 22, 2004, predating the film's release.

2025-02-05 20:05:33,738 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: According to the Primary Chronicle, the first ruler to start uniting East Slavic lands into what has become known as Kievan Rus' was Prince Oleg (882-912). He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper River valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east, and he moved his capital to the more strategic Kiev. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Kievan Rus' territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars. Vladimir the Great (980-1015) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Kievan Rus and beyond. Kievan Rus' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054).

This decision was reinforced upon Namibian independence in 1990 when English was enshrined as one of the nation's official languages in the constitution. The rising of Mandela's youth league and the 1951 defiance campaign in South Africa promoted English as a language associated with the campaign against apartheid, potentially influencing its importance in Namibian society. However, it is important to note that while English was established as an official language in Namibia, it was not designated as the sole official language in the constitution after independence in 1990. The evidence does not provide specific details about the key figures or entities involved in the decision to choose English as Namibia's main national language in 1985.

The evidence does not provide specific details about the key figures or entities involved in the decision to choose English as Namibia's main national language in 1985.

They employed abstract philosophical and logical categorizations that, while more aligned with abstract philosophy than practical taxonomy, contributed to the evolution of the field beyond Aristotle's initial concepts. Aristotle's classification focused on animals, categorizing them into Blooded (vertebrates), Viviparous quadrupeds (land mammals), Birds, Oviparous quadrupeds (reptiles and amphibians), Fish, and Cetaceans (Aristotle did not realize their mammalian nature). Plants and fungi were not explicitly classified in his system, with plants being placed at the bottom of his hierarchical classification due to their perceived lack of intelligence and reasoning, followed by animals with varying levels of intellectual capacity, and humans at the top as the most intellectually complex beings.

Plainly, the enterprise of categorialism inaugurated by Aristotle runs deep in the philosophical psyche.

The team has a history of success in the playoffs, having made appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals 8 times, in 1974, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1985, 1987, 1997, and 2010. Their most recent playoff series victory was in the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Flyers last qualified for the playoffs in 2017-18. Given their strong playoff performance in recent years, it is likely that they will make the playoffs again in April 2021.

Tracy pretended to be pregnant and used money intended for an abortion to buy expensive shoes. When Shelley revealed she was pregnant with Charlie's baby, she left, leading to a brief split between Tracy and Charlie before they reconciled. Charlie later started an affair with Maria Sutherland (Samia Smith). When David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) discovered the affair, he blackmailed Charlie. In retaliation, Charlie attempted to drown David in the bath. Tracy found out about the affair, leading to another split between her and Charlie. Seeking revenge, Tracy pretended to reconcile with Charlie before ultimately killing him in self-defense. However, the court found her guilty and sentenced her to life in prison for the crime.

2025-02-05 20:33:13,887 - __main__ - INFO - Statement revised to: While navigating the challenging streets of Moscow, Barnes and Roan seek refuge but are unexpectedly captured by a group of purgers. Before facing a dire situation, Joe and Marcos come to their aid, eliminating the gang after observing the duo's plight from the store's rooftop. Finding safety in the store, Laney arrives and confronts their leader, reducing the group's numbers. As other purgers threaten to breach their hideout, the team manages to escape to a more secure location. Later, they encounter an ambush by Danzinger in a helicopter and seek shelter beneath an overpass, where Barnes discovers a tracking bullet embedded in him. Despite the common belief that bullets need to be removed, Barnes decides to leave it in after considering the risks of extraction. The team then encounters a large group of crips and assists their injured leader. In gratitude, the crips mislead the paramilitary team by planting the bullet in another location, ultimately eliminating them.
