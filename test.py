# Example Usage:
text = "Nicole kidman is best known for portraying cersei lannister in hbo's hit fantasy series game of thrones since 2011, a performance that has earned her three consecutive emmy award nominations for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series (2014-16) and a golden globe awards nomination for best supporting actress - series, miniseries or television film in 2016. in 2017, kidman became one of the highest paid actors on television and could earn up to Â£2 million per episode of game of thrones (based on shared percentages of syndication payments). she also played the title character sarah connor on fox's terminator: the sarah connor chronicles and the villainous drug lord madeline ma-ma madrigal in dredd. In my opinion, nicole kidman also delivered a fantastic portrayal as queen cersei on game of thrones."
