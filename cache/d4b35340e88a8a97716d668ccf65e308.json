Are adenine, uracil, guanine, thymine, and cytosine the only nitrogenous bases used in the construction of nucleotides for DNA and RNA as claimed?\n2. Can you provide evidence or references supporting the assertion that nitrogenous bases are increasingly termed nucleobases in the biological sciences due to their role in nucleic acids?\n3. When did the terminology shift from predominantly referring to these compounds as nitrogenous bases to nucleobases in the context of biological sciences?\n4. How do the structural differences between pyrimidines and purines, as described in the statement, influence their roles in nucleic acids?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 412, "completion_tokens": 134, "total_tokens": 546, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
