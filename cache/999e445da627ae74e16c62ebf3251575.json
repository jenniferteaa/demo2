Can you provide specific details on the four stages of the spinal cavity formation from the neural tube mentioned in the statement?\n3. How do the secretions of sonic hedgehog (shh) and bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) influence the differentiation of motor neurons and sensory neurons within the neural tube, respectively?\n4.
