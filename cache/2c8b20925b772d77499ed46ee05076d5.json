The regulation sought to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-liter pre-war Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-liter supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war supercharged 3-liter Grand Prix cars were banned. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held on 1 September, which was won by Giuseppe Campari in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.\n\n1. Who established the regulations based on engine capacity that shaped the formula in the beginning and what specific rules were set regarding the participation of different types of cars?\n2. Can you provide evidence or sources confirming the participation of non-supercharged 4.5-liter pre-war Grand Prix cars racing against the pre-war 1.5-liter supercharged 'voiturettes', and the banning of pre-war supercharged 3-liter Grand Prix cars?\n3. How did the 1946 Turin Grand Prix's outcome, where Giuseppe Campari won in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta, demonstrate the effectiveness of the new regulations in balancing supercharged and normally aspirated cars?\n4.
