Did Victor Safronov's 1969 book \"Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets\" introduce the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) as the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation?\n2. Can it be confirmed that the English translation of Safronov's book was indeed published in 1972, as stated?\n3. Is there concrete evidence to support the claim that Safronov's work in his book led to a significant shift in how scientists approached the formation of planets?\n4. Can the timeline of events be accurately established, showing how Safronov's ideas influenced the work of George Wetherill and the subsequent development of the SNDM theory throughout the universe?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 498, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
