He captained India under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia, and a few months later, made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of ODI specialist by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa. Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in 2013, Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016). In 2014, he became the top-ranked T20I batsman in the ICC rankings and holds the position, as of May 2017. Kohli joined the Indian cricket team in 2020.\n\n1. Can you provide evidence confirming Virat Kohli's representation of Delhi's cricket team at various age-group levels before his first-class debut in 2006?\n2. How can we verify that Kohli captained India under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia and made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka at the age of 19 shortly after?\n3. Is there concrete proof supporting Kohli's transition from playing as a reserve batsman to establishing himself as a regular in the ODI middle-order and being part of the 2011 World Cup-winning squad?\n4. Can you establish a timeline with reliable sources for Kohli's achievements in Test cricket, including his Test debut in 2011, Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa by 2013, and his rise to the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen in the same year?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 439, "completion_tokens": 440, "total_tokens": 879, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
