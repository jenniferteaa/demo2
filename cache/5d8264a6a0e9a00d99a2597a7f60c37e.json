In other words, a sister chromatid may also be said to be 'one-half' of the duplicated chromosome. A full set of sister chromatids is created during the synthesis (S) phase of interphase when all the chromosomes in a cell are replicated. The two sister chromatids remain attached to the nucleus until they are separated from each other during mitosis or during the second division of meiosis.\n\n1. Who first described the concept of sister chromatids and when was this term introduced into scientific literature?\n2. Can you provide a specific example of a process during which sister chromatids are separated from each other, as mentioned in the statement?\n3. How does the attachment of sister chromatids to the nucleus influence the process of cell division, particularly in mitosis and meiosis?\n4. What is the significance of sister chromatids in terms of genetic material and inheritance during cell division?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
