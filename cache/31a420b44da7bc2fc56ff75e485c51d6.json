Did delegates from five states indeed meet at the Annapolis Convention in September 1786 and call for a constitutional convention to discuss improvements to the Articles of Confederation?\n2. Can it be verified that the subsequent convention took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787, at the old Pennsylvania State House, later known as Independence Hall?\n3. Is it accurate that Rhode Island chose not to participate in the Constitutional Convention due to concerns about potential disadvantages?\n4. Can you provide evidence to support the claim that Rhode Island initially refused to ratify the Constitution but eventually did so in May 1790, influenced by George Washington and becoming the thirteenth state to ratify it?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 144, "total_tokens": 459, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
