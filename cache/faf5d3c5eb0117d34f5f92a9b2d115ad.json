He extended his control from Novgorod south along the Dnieper River valley to protect trade from Khazar incursions from the east, and he moved his capital to the more strategic Moscow. Sviatoslav I (died 972) achieved the first major expansion of Moscow Rus' territorial control, fighting a war of conquest against the Khazars. Vladimir the Great (980-1015) introduced Christianity with his own baptism and, by decree, extended it to all inhabitants of Moscow and beyond. Moscow Rus' reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054).\n\n1.
