Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill despite some concerns about ending the draft. The prolonged battle in the Senate finally ended in September 1971, with cloture achieved over the filibuster and the draft renewal bill approved. The end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam in December 1972 marked the last men conscripted, born in 1952, who reported for duty in June 1973. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced in early 1973 that no further draft orders would be issued, effectively putting an end to the military draft.\n\n1. Did Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska actively engage in filibustering the draft renewal legislation in June 1971 to end conscription and the war?\n2. How did Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts react to the draft renewal bill, and was there any significant opposition within their ranks regarding ending the draft?\n3. Can the timeline of events surrounding the end of active U.S. ground participation in Vietnam in December 1972 and the last men conscripted in June 1973 be corroborated with historical records?\n4. Is there concrete evidence to support Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird's announcement in early 1973 that no further draft orders would be issued, effectively ending the military draft?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens": 304, "total_tokens": 647, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
