Can you provide historical data or trends showcasing the salinity levels of the Red Sea over the past few decades to support the claim that it is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world?\n3. How does the salinity of the Red Sea compare to other bodies of water known for their high salinity, such as the Dead Sea or the Great Salt Lake, in terms of average salinity levels?\n4.
