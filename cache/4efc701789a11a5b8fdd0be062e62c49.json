The burial location was only mentioned as where the principal heap of ashes was found in the March 28 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register. Over the years, there has been confusion about the burial site, but some believe it is located at Mission San Francisco de la Espada. Remains believed to belong to the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando in 1936 and later re-interred in a marble sarcophagus. While some doubt whose remains are in the sarcophagus, others believe it holds the ashes of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, possibly buried at Mission San Francisco de la Espada.\n\n1. Who documented Juan Segu\u00edn's oversight of the 1837 recovery of the abandoned ashes and his officiation at the February 25 funeral at Mission San Francisco de la Espada?\n2. Can the specific issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register from March 28, which mentioned the burial location, be referenced to confirm the claim about the principal heap of ashes?\n3. What concrete evidence exists to support the claim that remains believed to belong to the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando in 1936 and later re-interred in a marble sarcophagus?\n4. Is there a definitive timeline or historical record that establishes the connection between the burial site confusion, the discovery of the remains at the Cathedral of San Fernando, and the belief that the sarcophagus holds the ashes of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 687, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
