Domestic sponsorships were allowed to run their course until 1998 when they naturally expired. The act also allowed the federal minister for health and ageing to grant exemptions for events of international significance that would not be held in Australia without tobacco advertising. This led to only two events being eligible by 2006 - the Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. However, in 2007, the Australian Grand Prix featured no tobacco advertising of any sort as the minister's right to grant exemptions was removed in 2006.\n\n1.
