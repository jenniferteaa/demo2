This tradition was continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556-1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605-27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628-58 CE) also solemnly greeted their subjects from this jharokha.\n\nCurrent statement to verify: However, Aurangzeb decided to stop this practice during his 11th year of reign because he believed it was not in line with Islamic principles, considering it a form of idol worship.\n\n1. Can you provide historical sources confirming that Aurangzeb indeed stopped the practice of darshan from the jharokha during his 11th year of reign?\n2. Are there documented statements or writings from Aurangzeb himself that explicitly mention his reasons for discontinuing this tradition, citing concerns about idol worship or conflicting with Islamic principles?\n3. Is there scholarly research or historical records that analyze Aurangzeb's reign, specifically focusing on any decrees or orders issued by him regarding cultural practices like darshan to corroborate this claim?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 305, "completion_tokens": 247, "total_tokens": 552, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null}
