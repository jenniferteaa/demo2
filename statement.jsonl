{"input_info": {"claim": "The spinal cavity is formed by the neural tube during development. there are four stages of the spinal cavity that arise from the neural tube: the neural plate, neural fold, neural tube, and the spinal cavity. neural differentiation occurs within the spinal cavity portion of the tube. as the neural tube begins to develop, the notochord begins to secrete a factor known as sonic hedgehog or shh. as a result, the floor plate then also begins to secrete shh, and this will induce the basal plate to develop motor neurons. during the maturation of the neural tube, its lateral walls thicken and form a longitudinal groove called the sulcus limitans. this extends the length of the spinal cavity into dorsal and ventral portions as well. meanwhile, the overlying ectoderm secretes bone morphogenetic protein (bmp). this induces the roof plate to begin to secrete bmp, which will induce the alar plate to develop sensory neurons. opposing gradients of such morphogens as bmp and shh form different domains of dividing cells along the dorsal ventral axis. dorsal root ganglion neurons differentiate from neural crest progenitors. as the dorsal and ventral column cells proliferate, the lumen of the neural tube narrows to form the small central canal of the spinal cavity. the alar plate and the basal plate are separated by the sulcus limitans. additionally, the floor plate also secretes netrins. the netrins act as chemoattractants to decussation of pain and temperature sensory neurons in the alar plate across the anterior white commissure, where they then ascend towards the thalamus. following the closure of the caudal neuropore and formation of the brain's ventricles that contain the choroid plexus tissue, the central canal of the caudal spinal cavity is filled with cerebrospinal fluid."}}
