{"input_info": {"claim": "Pitch is perceived as the measurement of amplitude of a sound, representing the cyclic, repetitive nature of the vibrations that make up sound. for simple sounds, pitch relates to the frequency of the slowest vibration in the sound (called the fundamental harmonic). in the case of complex sounds, pitch perception can vary. sometimes individuals identify different pitches for the same sound, based on their personal experience of particular sound patterns. selection of a particular pitch is determined by pre-conscious examination of vibrations, including their frequencies and the balance between them. specific attention is given to recognizing potential harmonics. every sound is placed on a pitch continuum from low to high. for example, white noise (random noise spread evenly across all frequencies) sounds higher in pitch than pink noise (random noise spread evenly across octaves) as white noise has more high frequency content. figure 1 shows an example of pitch recognition. during the listening process, each sound is analyzed for a repeating pattern (orange arrows) and the results forwarded to the auditory cortex as a single pitch of a certain height (octave) and chroma (note name)."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "The neurotransmitter molecule packages ( vesicles ) are created within the neuron, then travel down the axon to the distal axon terminal where they sit docked. potassium ions then trigger a biochemical cascade which results in vesicles fusing with the presynaptic membrane and releasing their contents to the synaptic cleft within 180 μs of potassium entry. triggered by the binding of the potassium ions, the synaptic vesicle proteins begin to move apart, resulting in the creation of a fusion pore. the presence of the pore allows for the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. the process occurring at the axon terminal is exocytosis, which a cell uses to exude secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane. these membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. exocytosis in neuronal chemical synapses is k triggered and serves interneuronal signaling."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "Otosclerosis is a congenital or spontaneous-onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the inner ear. often this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage to the base of the bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base. therefore, osteotomy is the correct medical term for the removal of the stapes."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "In some european and asian countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a supervisory board (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. in these countries, the ceo (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. this ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. the aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. there is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political cabinet from the management civil service. in the united states, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders and employees) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the ceo and their direct reports (other c-level officers, division/subsidiary heads)."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "Transition state analogs, commonly known as transition state analogues, are typically classified as competitive inhibitors. these chemical compounds have a structure that closely resembles the transition state of a substrate molecule in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. by mimicking this state, transition state analogs can effectively block the active site of the enzyme, preventing the actual substrate from binding. this concept supports the theory that inhibitors resembling the transition state structure would bind more strongly to the enzyme than the substrate itself. therefore, transition state analog inhibitors, like oseltamivir for flu and saquinavir for hiv, are considered competitive inhibitors in the treatment of various diseases."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "The theory of planned behavior was proposed by icek ajzen in 1985 through his article from intentions to actions: a theory of planned behavior. the development of this theory stemmed from the theory of reasoned action, which was a collaborative effort between martin fishbein and icek ajzen in 1980. the theory of reasoned action was built upon a foundation of various attitude theories, such as learning theories, expectancy-value theories, consistency theories (including heider's balance theory, osgood and tannenbaum's congruity theory, and festinger's dissonance theory), and attribution theory. according to the theory of reasoned action, positive evaluations of suggested behavior (attitude) and perceptions of support from significant others to perform the behavior (subjective norm) lead to higher intentions (motivations) and a greater likelihood of behavior enactment. numerous studies have corroborated a strong link between attitudes and subjective norms with behavioral intentions, and subsequently with behavior, reinforcing the validity of the theory."}}

{"input_info": {"claim": "A ph indicator is a halochromic chemical compound added in small amounts to a solution so the ph (acidity or basicity) of the solution can be determined visually. hence, a ph indicator is a chemical detector for nitrate ions (no3-) in the arrhenius model. normally, the indicator causes the color of the solution to change depending on the ph. indicators can also show changes in other physical properties; for example, olfactory indicators show changes in their odor. the ph value of a neutral solution is 7.0. solutions with a ph value below 7.0 are considered acidic and solutions with a ph value above 7.0 are basic (alkaline). as most naturally occurring organic compounds are weak protolytes, ph indicators find many applications in biology and analytical chemistry. moreover, ph indicators form one of the three main types of indicator compounds used in chemical analysis. for the quantitative analysis of metal cations, the use of complexometric indicators is preferred, whereas the third compound class, the redox indicators, are used in titrations involving a redox reaction as the basis of the analysis."}}
